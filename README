# Domain To IP Converter.
#### Tired of those pesky ISP's blocking your favorite site while you were heated as f? Try this method. It might just works.

In a nutshell, what is this software does is to fetch a list of websites that (might be) blocked from a repository, get the IP for those domain, and then print the output that you can replace to the hosts file.

## TODO
* Complete UI Interface


### Why not use [This Program?](https://github.com/gvoze32/unblockhostid)

__*TL;DR : It sucks. Don't use that. Stay away from it.__

While yeah, it is working, the list is updated (almost) daily, this program is even using the list from that repository. The software is just sucks to use.

First, what's that software does is replacing the hosts file on the system with the hosts file on the software.

Yep, **_Replacing._**

Which is **MIND BOGGLING**. Why do they have to replace the file?! Why the hell do they replace the hosts file rightaway?! They can just include the hosts that've been added before! It's not that hard. Hell, it's not even difficult. I can do it in C# with 3 lines of code.

**_3 LINES OF CODE._**

Just look at [My implementation](https://github.com/RoganMatrivski/Domain-To-IP-Converter/blob/7037af4d1e9f425f67399cb09cb8ee09d39a1a9d/DomainToIPConverter/Program.cs#L125-L127) for this. Simple, right? It might not be the best way to do things, but it's the simplest one. And yet they didn't do it. 

Why. Why do you have to do this gvoze32? Why are we here, just to suffer?

*_cough_

The second is, they added a paywall to access the option menu.

What the hell?

Sure, you can say that as "donation". But, hiding a feature behind a "donation" sure looks more like a paywall to me. I don't even know what's behind that paywall anyways.

And finally, they even add an advertising for their services. (Which might not even legal).

Holy shit, those guys are a disgrace for the open source community.
